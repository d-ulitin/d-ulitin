ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm C++ developer ðŸ”¨, mechanical & electronic designer âš¡.

I'm using:
* C++ (gcc, clang)
* Windows/Linux

My pet-project is scanning old photoraphies with a digital camera (digitization). My own process of digitalization:
* build a stand, setup high-CRI light
* profile the camera with ColorChecher & dcamprof
* scan photos
* apply profiles & make basic color correction
* upload & sent link to relatives to make them happy

I'm fond of photography. I can profile a digital camera with ColorChecker & dcamprof.
